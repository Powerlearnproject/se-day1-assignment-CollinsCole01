Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software systems in a systematic and structured way. 
Importances of softwae engineering include;- 
(i) It enables innovation - It fuels innovation like developing AI models, breakthrough on streaming platform services.
(ii) It's critical for effeciency and reliability - Well engineered software keeps system fast, secure and bug free which is essential for users. 
(iii) It's a huge economic engine - Its a massive driver for economic growth, Tech giants and startups alike depend on software to build products, reach customers and generate revenue, powering jobs and growth across the globe. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Birth of structured programming (1960s) 
Back in the early days coding was free for all, but when structured programming was introduced, clear logical structurers like loop and conditionals, laying the groundwork for modern coding practices. it made software more reliable and easier to manage. 
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
In the 1980s object-oriented programming took off, with languages like smalltalk and later C++ and Java leading the charge. It introduced the idea of organizing code into reusable objects that mimic real worlds entities. It made software development faster, more modular and easier to scale. Big systems like windows or enterprise software owe a lot to this shift. 
The Agile Manifesto (2001)
The Agile Manifesto prioritized flexibility, collaboration and delivering working software fast over rigid plans and endless documentation. It transformed the industry enabling tech companies to iterate quickly, adapt to user feedback and keep up with the breakneck pace of today's digital world.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

(i) Planning
This is where it all starts, Its figuring out what the software needs to do, whos going to use it and what resources are required. 
(ii) Requirements Analysis 
This phase involves gathering input from users to define specific features and functions.
(iii) Design 
With all requirements at hand, in this phase its about sketching out the software how it will work. The system layouts, databases, user interfaces and how different parts will connect. 
(iv) Implementation (coding)
This is where the developers take the design and turn it into an actual code. This is the hands on phase writing, testing and making sure it matches the design specs. 
(v) Testing 
Once its built, you've got to make sure it doesn't flop, Testing checks for bugs, performance issues or anything that doesn't meet the requirements. 
(vi) Deployment 
This is time to Launch, the software gets rolled out to users. It could be a full release or a phased one. 
(vii) Maintenance 
Maintanance is about keeping the software running, fixing bugs and updating it for new devices or security threats and adding features as needs change. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
